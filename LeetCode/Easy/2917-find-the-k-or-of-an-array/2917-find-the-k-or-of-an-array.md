## 2917. Find the K-or of an Array
You are given an integer array nums, and an integer k. Let's introduce K-or operation by extending the standard bitwise OR. In K-or, a bit position in the result is set to 1 if at least k numbers in nums have a 1 in that position.

Return the K-or of nums.

### Example 1:

> Input: nums = [7,12,9,8,9,15], k = 4
> 
> Output: 9
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> Represent numbers in binary:
> 
> | Number | Bit 3	| Bit 2	| Bit 1	| Bit 0 |
> | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
> | 7	  |  0	| 1   | 	1	| 1
> | 12  |	 1	| 1   | 	0	| 0
> | 9	  |  1	| 0   | 	0	| 1
> | 8	  |  1	| 0   | 	0	| 0
> | 9	  |  1	| 0   | 	0	| 1
> | 15	|  1  | 1	  |   1	| 1
> |Result = 9|	1	| 0	| 0	| 1
> 
> Bit 0 is set in 7, 9, 9, and 15. Bit 3 is set in 12, 9, 8, 9, and 15.<br/>
> Only bits 0 and 3 qualify. The result is (1001)2 = 9.

### Example 2:

> Input: nums = [2,12,1,11,4,5], k = 6
> 
> Output: 0
> 
> Explanation: No bit appears as 1 in all six array numbers, as required for K-or with k = 6. Thus, the result is 0.

### Example 3:

> Input: nums = [10,8,5,9,11,6,8], k = 1
> 
> Output: 15
> 
> Explanation: Since k == 1, the 1-or of the array is equal to the bitwise OR of all its elements. Hence, the answer is 10 OR 8 OR 5 OR 9 OR 11 OR 6 OR 8 = 15.

### Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 50
- 0 <= nums[i] < 231
- 1 <= k <= nums.length
